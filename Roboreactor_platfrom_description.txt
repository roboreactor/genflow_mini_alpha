Roboreactor is the platform to help you build robotic and automation systems faster and with rich functionality to control general-purpose mobile computers to build robotics and automation systems at timeless and reduce complexity in tasks to help you build interesting and cool robotics and automation systems with Roboreactor node generator to generate the code from the website into the robot and automation system from anywhere in the world with no gap in development and 
we have a function to help you manage the components that you need for the project allow you to manage the components and code to match the functionality with the complete hardware you uploaded into the  project and code that you generated on the website help you to manage the functionality of the system remotely via Roboreactor profile website and we have motion planning to connect with your robot remotely via our fast IoT system 
to allow you to control the robot motion system faster from anywhere allow you to run the robot under development with no gap of distances. 
The IoT on the Roboreactor allows you to manage data from the robot in real-time to help you collect and visualize data from the robot and pave the way to agile development for AI and digital twins on the robot.
from the IoT advantage, we can combine this function to allow you to use it to visualize the data from Lidar to make the navigation system from a robot into the website.
Inside the node, functionality communicates with the UDP to send the data from one node to the other allowing you to replicate the function to control as many devices as you can in the local network
increasing the possibility to do swarm and group tasks better inside the node that you replicate on each device.
